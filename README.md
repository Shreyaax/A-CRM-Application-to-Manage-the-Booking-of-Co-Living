# Co-Living Space Application

## Project Overview

The **Co-Living Space** application is designed to create a vibrant and inclusive community where individuals can live, work, and connect with like-minded people. By fostering collaboration and reducing isolation, we aim to enhance the overall quality of life in a shared living environment.

This platform allows users to:

- Choose daily special food items.
- Make payments through various payment modes.
- Provide feedback on services such as room cleaning, internet connectivity, and food quality.
